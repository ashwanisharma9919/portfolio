                <p>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

                    JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

                    JavaScript is easy to learn.

                    This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
                    <br>

                    Creation at Netscape
                    The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to
                    non-technical people,
                    it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web. The lead
                    developers of Mosaic then
                    founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in
                    1994. This quickly
                    became the most-used.

                    During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for
                    dynamic behavior
                    after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development
                    scene to remove this
                    limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two
                    routes to achieve
                    this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring
                    Brendan Eich to
                    embed the Scheme language.

                    Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with
                    syntax similar to Java
                    and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.Although the new language and its
                    interpreter
                    implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September
                    1995, the name was
                    changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.

                    The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to
                    Java. At the time, the
                    dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a
                    marketing ploy by
                    Netscape.
